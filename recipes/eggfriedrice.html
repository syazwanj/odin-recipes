  <h1>Egg Fried Rice</h1>
  <p>
    Egg fried rice is an essential staple of any Asian household. Whether as a proper meal at any time
    of the day or a late night snack, fried rice is there to soothe not just the stomach but also the soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have a wok, use it and use it well. Get that <em>wok hey</em> flavour infused into it. If not,
    a regular frying pan will do the job, albeit without the wok hey.

    <li>3 cups leftover cooked white rice</li>

      Place carrots in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a low boil
      and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in peas, then immediately drain in a colander.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a wok over high heat. Pour in vegetable oil, then stir in the carrots, peas, and garlic; 
      cook for about 30 seconds. Add eggs; stir quickly to scramble eggs with vegetables.
    </li>
    <li>

  </ol>
  <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it: Combine 4 cups water and 2
    cups white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until
    rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 26 minutes. Remove from
    the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the best fried rice results,
    cover and refrigerate the rice, 8 hours to overnight, before using in
    this recipe.
