  <p>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would <em>float off the plate!</em></p>
  <h2>Here's what you need:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup cold water or milk</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Whisk <strong>water and baking soda</strong> together in a mixing bowl. Add
      <strong>ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, egg and vanilla.</strong> 
      Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add <strong>melted butter, 
      lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour.</strong> Whisk together,
      stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter
    </li>
    <li>Let the batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion
      out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form
      on the surface and the edges of the pancakes look dry, (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook
      other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.
    </li>
  </ol>
